# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added
- Local matchmaker queue and environment files have a new `Fetch from Remote` command in the Deployment Window that will override the local configuration with the content from the Cloud Dashboard configuration.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where Matchmaker configuration assets would not deploy with their latest changes from the Deployment Window.
- Fixed Lobby events being raised before re-subscribing when joining the same Lobby again.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Custom inspector for `.gsh` files.

### Changed
- Removed error logging for unknown Lobby patch paths over Wire to support future Distributed Authority state updates.

### Fixed
- Fixed assets being loaded despite being of the incorrect type.
- Fixed stale data used when deploying `.gsh` files via the deployment window.
- Resolved an issue where the `Task` would resolve before the `NetworkManager` was fully connected and synchronized when using Netcode for GameObjects.
- Resolved an issue where the `Task` would resolve before the `NetworkManager` had finished shutting down when using Netcode for GameObjects.
- Resolved an issue where some settings on the `NetworkManager` would stay changed after leaving a Distributed Authority session.
- Fixed an issue where joining clients to a relay hosted game (either with Relay or Distributed Authority) would not be able to connect because the relay protocol is invalid for their platform. The RelayProtocol from the `_session_network` property is now ignored by joining and reconnecting players. Players will always use the `RelayProtocol.Default` value instead.

## [1.1.8] - 2025-09-09

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where a rule without a reference could not be deployed.

## [1.1.7] - 2025-08-19

### Changed
- The user-provided allocation callback is now guaranteed to be invoked regardless of whether the session is created successfully.
  - If session creation fails, the `OnAllocate` callback will still be invoked. This means you must check whether the Session is null before using it. The deallocation callback will be invoked once the server times out.
- The user-provided deallocation callback is now guaranteed to be invoked.

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where the server, upon failing to create a session, would be left in a broken state.

## [1.2.0-pre.1] - 2025-08-06

### Added
- Added support for Host Migration in lobbies:
  - Added migration operations `GetMigrationDataInfoAsync`, `DownloadMigrationDataAsync` and `UploadMigrationDataAsync`.
- Added support for Host Migration in sessions:
  - Added `WithHostMigration` session option to enable automatic netcode snapshots at a configurable interval.
    - It requires an implementation of `IMigrationDataHandler` which defines how data is generated and applied.
    - We provide a default migration data handler implementation for Netcode with Entities (Minimum required version 1.7.0)
  - Added migration data methods to `IHostSession`: `GetHostMigrationDataAsync` and `SetHostMigrationDataAsync` for manual implementations.
  - Added host migration flow to restart the network on session host changed
  - Added `SessionHostChanged` and `SessionMigrated` event on `ISession`.
  - Added optional parameter `preserveRegion` to `RelayOptions` to configure relay reallocation behavior during host migration. Setting this to true saves the region of the first relay allocation and reuses when a relay server is reallocated during host migration.
- Adding concurrency control settings to the lobby service and to sessions. When enabled, a [If-Match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Match) header will be sent and an exception will now be thrown in case of conflict for the following operations:
  - deleting a lobby or session
  - removing a player from a lobby or session
  - updating a lobby or session player
  - updating a lobby or session
- Added `SessionObserver` class that allows to listen to `ISession` lifecycle for a specific `ISession.Type`.
- Added `AddingSessionStarted` and `AddingSessionFailed` events inside `IMultiplayerService`.
- Added overloads for `WithRelayNetwork` and `WithDistributedAuthorityNetwork` to enable manual setting of the underlying network protocol. Defaults left as before: Most platforms keep using DTLS as a default connection and WebGL still defaults to WSS. Use the `RelayNetworkOptions` variant to override the default behavior.
- Added a `WithDirectNetwork` overload that accepts `DirectNetworkOptions` which takes `ListenIpAddress` and `PublishIpAddress` parameters.
- Added a `WithDirectNetwork` overload that accepts no arguments, ensuring backward compatibility with the previous `WithDirectNetwork` overload.
- Added player name integration into multiplayer sessions
  - `WithPlayerName()` session option for a player to provide their name into a multiplayer session.
  - `GetPlayerName()` extension method to the session `IReadOnlyPlayer` model to retrieve a player's name.
- Added `IsServer` property in `ISession` to validate if the local owner of the session handle is a server managing the session.
- Added `HasPlayer` method in `ISession` to easily validate if a player is in a session.
- Added `GetPlayer` methods in `ISession` & `IHostSesssion` to easily access a specific player model by player id.
- The default network handler implementation for netcode for entities will now automatically create client & server worlds if none are available when starting a network connection.
- Added an Inspector for Matchmaker queue files to allow the edition of the most common properties of the Matchmaker Queue configuration in the editor.
- Added `Network` property  to provide control over the network managed by the Session.
  - `IHostSession` provides the `IHostSessionNetwork` interface which lets you control the network connection for the session.
  - `ISession` provides the `IClientSessionNetwork` interface which lets you access the network state and relevant events.
  - Come in and out of games within the same multiplayer session.
  - Wait for specific conditions before starting the network connection and your gameplay
    - Session reaching max players
    - All players marking themselves as ready through player properties
    - Etc.
- Added `Network` property on `ISession` (`IClientSessionNetwork`) & `IHostSession` (`IHostSessionNetwork`) to provide control over the network managed by the Session. This can let you come in and out of games within the same multiplayer session.
- Adding parameter validation for `IMultiplayerServerService.StartMultiplaySessionManagerAsync`. An `ArgumentNullException` will be throw if the following values are not provided
  - `MultiplaySessionManagerOptions`
  - `MultiplaySessionManagerOptions.SessionOptions`
  - `MultiplaySessionManagerOptions.MultiplayServerOptions`
- Added a new `MatchmakerQueueAsset` class created when importing `.mmq` files that can be referenced from runtime assets.
- Added a new `BuildProfile` reference and `BuildOptions` settings to the `.gsh` file description to allow Multiplay Server Hosting build deployment to perform more specific builds.
- Added an Inspector for `.gsh` files to allow the edition of the most common properties of the Multiplay configuration in the editor.

### Changed
- Trying to use an unsupported connection protocol on WebGL will throw an `ArgumentException` instead of logging a warning message.
- Matchmaker queue and environment configuration files will display their status against the remote configuration in the cloud project from the Deployment Window.
- Changed `IMultiplaySessionManager.StartMultiplaySessionManagerAsync` to await the full allocation and session initialization flow and to cover all potential errors.
- Removed exception thrown when trying to access the session property in `IMultiplaySessionManager.Session` as we now guarantee full initialization.
