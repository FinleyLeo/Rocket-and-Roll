# Best Practices

## Improve iteration speed of the Play Mode Scenarios

### Disable domain reload

The Play Mode Scenarios are compatible with domain reload.
However, the larger the project, the larger it affects the iteration time.
One way to quickly improve iteration speed, is then to disable domain reload.
To disable domain reload, go to **Edit > Project Settings > Editor**. Under **Enter Play Mode settings > When entering Play Mode** , select **Reload Scene Only** or **Do not reload Domain or Scene**.
